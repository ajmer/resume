					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
                                        <p>
                                                I am a highly experienced SQL Server consultant who has worked for organisations ranging from small start-ups to global software vendors in industries ranging from banking to digital remarketing.<br/>
                                                I have worked in roles ranging from consultancy and architecture to reliability engineering and database administration.<br/>
                                                This combination of experience and roles has enabled me to develop a proven track record for delivering projects ranging from tuning critical low-latency trading systems, developing and maintaining clickstream ingesting digital remarketing applications, ensuring vital banking systems are highly available and resilient, and implementing public and private cloud-based database automation solutions.<br/>
                                                As a result, I have a broadened perspective on the technical complexities of implementing efficient and reliable database solutions, allowing me to liaise more effectively with diverse stakeholders to successfully deliver projects, mentor colleagues and act as a database SME.
